# Ansible Linux Dev Playbook
This is a playbook that sets up my Fedora Linux Experiences
This will be Fedora for now, though all my experiences were with Debian Based,
Macs only have Asahi Fedora For now, so I will be setting this for now. 
I think it might be possible to have separate plays that run only 
on spefici systems, and other stuff that is universal like my .dotfiles, zsh
tmux, neovim could still run universally.

2. Have Git (to clone this repo)
